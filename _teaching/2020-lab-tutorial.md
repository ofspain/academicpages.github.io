I Guided undergraduate through the act of simulation and control of simple chemical processes using tools such as Matlab(simulink), Java. I also implemented simple Model predictive control scheme using mathematical models of a two tank system.
I also assisted in the supervision and grading of undergraduate lab work involving these
