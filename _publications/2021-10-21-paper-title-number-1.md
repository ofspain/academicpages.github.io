permalink: /publication/2021-10-21-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This work deep dived into the homeostasis of calcium in the body and attempt to model this with data gotten from the numeric simulation of mathematical model representing the system. A system of Diffrential Algebraic eqaution were sloved to generate data used to train a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) neural network.'
